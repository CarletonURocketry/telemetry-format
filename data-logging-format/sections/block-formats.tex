\subsection{Logging Metadata Blocks}
\label{subsec:logging-metadata-blocks}

Logging metadata blocks are used to store metadata generated by the logging
system and information required in order to correctly parse the logged data.

The block types within the Logging Metadata class are described in table
\ref{table:logging-metadata-types}.

\begin{table*}[htb]

\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Data Type           &   Description \\
\midrule
0x0                 &   Spacer block \\
0x1 through 0x3FF   &   Reserved for future use \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Logging metadata block types}

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Spacer Block}

Spacer blocks are used when writing telemetry data to indicate a region that
does not contain any valid data. When telemetry is being written one SD card
block at a time without the ability to have telemetry data overflow from one
block into another, a spacer block can be used at the end of the SD card block
to take up any excess bytes.

When parsing, spacer blocks should always be skiped using the length field in
the block header and no attempt should be made to parse a spacer block's
payload.




\subsection{Telemetry Data Blocks}
\label{subsec:telemetry-data-blocks}

Data blocks of the Telemetry class follow the formats specified in the CU
InSpace Radio Packet Format document.

\subsection{Diagnostic Data Blocks}
\label{subsec:diagnostic-data-blocks}

Data blocks with the Diagnostic Data class are used to store information which
is intended to be used for debugging.

The block types within the Diagnostic Data class are described in table
\ref{table:diagnostic-data-types}.

\begin{table*}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Data Type           &   Description \\
\midrule
0x0                 &   Log message \\
0x1                 &   Outgoing radio packet \\
0x2                 &   Incoming radio packet \\
0x3 through 0x3FF   &   Reserved for future use \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Diagnostic data block types}
\label{table:diagnostic-data-types}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Log Message}

Log messages are string messages intended to provide human readable debugging
output. They are encoded as UTF-8 strings and do not require a terminating NUL
character because the string length can be extrapolated from the block length.
Every log message is preceded by a 32 bit unsigned mission time value.

Note that like all other data blocks log messages must be a multiple of four
bytes long. If the string to be logged is not a multiple of four bytes it must
be padded with NUL characters at the end to make it fit the required alignment.
The length recorded in the block header must be a multiple of four, and
therefore must include any NUL padding bytes at the end of the string.
