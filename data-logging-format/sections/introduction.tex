The following format specification describes how Carleton University InSpace logs telemetry data and diagnostic
information on an SD card from a telemetry device. This format makes use of the CU InSpace radio packet format for
logging telemetry data. This greatly simplifies encoding, and ensures that all outgoing radio messages are recorded in
the case that they are not delivered to the recipient.

This packet format is made publicly available via the GNUGPLv3 license.
