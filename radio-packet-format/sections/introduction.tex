\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

In order to efficiently communicate telemetry data between various devices, Carleton University In Space has devised
its own unique packet format for transmission over LoRa radio. The packet format is not only used for radio
communications, but also for logging telemetry data in-flight.

This packet format is made publicly available via the GNUGPLv3 license.

The packet format which follows is used for three primary purposes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Transmitting telemetry data.
    \item Controlling telemetry systems.
    \item Transmitting devices statuses.
\end{itemize}
