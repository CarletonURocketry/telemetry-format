\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

In order to efficiently communicate telemetry data between various devices, Carleton University InSpace has devised its
own unique packet format for transmission over LoRa radio. The packet format is not only used for radio communications,
but also for logging telemetry data in-flight.

This packet format is made publicly available via the MIT license.

The packet format which follows is made to efficiently transmit flight data recorded by sensors alongside their
measurement times. LoRa is a low bandwidth protocol, so it is critical to minimize any unnecessary control information
where possible.
