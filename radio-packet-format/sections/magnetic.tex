\subsection{3-Axis Magnetic Field}

The magnetic field block is used to convey generic 3-axis magnetometer data. This block is intended to abstract
over the details of any individual magnetometer. The format of the 3-axis magnetic field block payload is described in figure
\ref{format:telem-magnetic}.

\paragraph{*-Axis}

These fields represent the magnetic field measurements for each axis. These fields are signed integers in two's
complement format.

The unit of measurement for each axis is milligauss.

The magnetic field measurements are relative to the rocket's heading. If the magnetometer Z-axis is parallel with the rocket,
then the magnetic field in the z-axis is also a parallel vector.
