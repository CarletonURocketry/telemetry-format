\subsubsection{Reset Rocket Avionics}

When this block is received by the rocket avionics the rocket’s microcontroller will be reset. If this block’s ACK
requested bit is set the acknowledgement will be sent before the avionics reset. The acknowledgements for any other
blocks in the same packet as the reset command are not guaranteed to be sent. This block sub-type does not have any
payload data.
