\subsection{Data Blocks}

Data blocks contain telemetry data. The possible sub-types data blocks are listed in table \ref{table:data-subtypes}.

Some sub-types may have identical encoding, but a different interpretation. For example, all altitude measurements are
encoded in millimetres. However, "sea level altitude" is measured in millimetres above sea level whilst "launch level
altitude" is measured in millimetres above launch height. When reviewing the encoding for a data type, the description
will mention how the encoded value should be interpreted. For example, in the case of altitude, the millimetre
measurement should be interpreted as being relative to sea level if the block header specifies a sub-type of "sea level
altitude".

Note that all \textbf{mission time} fields are measured in milliseconds since launch, and are all unsigned 32-bit
integers.

Any integer fields larger than 1 byte are in little-endian format. Any signed integers are in two's complement format.
This is because fields are packaged using C structs on a little endian machine (the de-facto standard).
