\subsubsection{Voltage}

The voltage data block reports the voltage measured on a specific electrical trace within the rocket. The measurement
is associated with a generic numerical ID for identification by the receiver. This allows multiple voltage points to be
measured within the rocket. The format of the voltage block payload is described in figure \ref{format:telem-voltage}.

\paragraph{Measurement Time}
The mission time when the measurement was taken.

\paragraph{ID}
A numerical ID associated with the voltage measurement for identification by the receiver. This field is an unsigned 16
bit integer.

\paragraph{Voltage}
The measured voltage in units of millivolts. This field is a signed 16 bit integer.
