\subsubsection{Acceleration}

The acceleration block is used to convey generic 3-axis accelerometer data. This block is intended to abstract over the
details of any individual accelerometer. The format of the acceleration block payload is described in figure
\ref{format:telem-acceleration}.

\paragraph{Measurement Time}
The mission time when the measurement was taken.

\paragraph{*-Axis}
These fields represent the acceleration measurements for each axis. These fields are signed integers in two's
complement format.

The unit of measurement for each axis is measured in centimetres per second squared. That is, dividing the value in each
axis field by 100 will give the standard acceleration unit of metres per second squared.
