\subsubsection{Angular Velocity}

The angular velocity block is used to convey generic 3-axis gyroscope data. This block is intended to abstract over the
details of any individual gyroscope. The format of the acceleration block payload is described in figure
\ref{format:telem-angular-velocity}.

\paragraph{Measurement Time}
The mission time when the measurement was taken.

\paragraph{*-Axis}
These fields represent the angular velocity measurements for each axis. These fields are signed integers in two's
complement format.

Each field describes angular velocity in tenths of degrees per second. In other words, dividing this field by 10 will
give you angular rotation in a standard unit of degrees per second.
