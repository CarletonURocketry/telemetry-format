\subsubsection{Debug Message}

Debug messages are string messages intended to provide human readable debugging output. They are encoded as UTF-8
strings and do not require a terminating NULL character because the string length can be extrapolated from the block
length. Every debug message is preceded by a 32 bit unsigned mission time value. See Figure \ref{format:telem-debug}.

Note that like all other data blocks, debug messages must be a multiple of four bytes long. If the string to be logged
is not a multiple of four bytes it must be padded with NULL characters at the end to make it fits the required
alignment. The length recorded in the block header must be a multiple of four, and therefore must include any NULL
padding bytes at the end of the string.
