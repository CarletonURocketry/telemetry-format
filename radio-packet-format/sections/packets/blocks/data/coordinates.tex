\subsubsection{Coordinates}

The coordinates block is used to convey the geographical (latitude and longitude) coordinates of the rocket. The format
of the coordinates block is described in figure \ref{format:telem-coordinate}.

\paragraph{Measurement Time}
The mission time when the measurement was taken.

\paragraph{Latitude}
Measured in micro-degrees. This field is a signed 32 bit integer. To convert to degrees, divide by $10^7$.

\paragraph{Longitude}
Measured in micro-degrees. This field is a signed 32 bit integer. To convert to degrees, divide by $10^7$.
