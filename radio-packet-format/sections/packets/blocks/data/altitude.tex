\subsubsection{Altitude}

The altitude block is used to convey altimeter data. This block contains both the altitude value calculated by the
rocket and the raw pressure and temperature values if they are available. The format of the altitude block payload is
described in figure \ref{format:telem-altitude}.

\paragraph{Measurement Time}
The mission time when the measurement was taken.

\paragraph{Pressure}
The measured pressure in units of Pascals. This field is a signed 32 bit integer in two's complement format.

\paragraph{Temperature}
The measured temperature in units of 1 millidegree Celsius/LSB. This field is a signed 32 bit integer in two's
complement format.

\paragraph{Altitude}
The calculated altitude in units of \SI{1}{\milli\meter\per LSB}. This field is a signed 32 bit integer in two's
complement format.
