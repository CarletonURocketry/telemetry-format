\section{Other Considerations} \label{sec:other-considerations}

This section contains other considerations for the radio packet format beyond its layout.

\subsection {Deduplication}
\label{subsec:other-considerations_deduplication}

\subsection{Endianness}

All fields are little endian unless otherwise indicated.

\subsection{Alignment}

The start of all data blocks must be aligned to a four byte boundary within the packet. To facilitate this data blocks
must be padded to ensure that their lengths are always a multiple of four bytes. Padding bytes should be set to zero
when transmitting and their content should be ignored by the receiver.

\subsection{Reserved Fields}

Reserved fields should be set to zero when transmitting and ignored when receiving.
