\subsection {Deduplication}
\label{subsec:other-considerations_deduplication}

\subsection{Endianness}

All fields are little endian unless otherwise indicated.

\subsection{Alignment}

The start of all data blocks must be alligned to a four byte boundry within the
packet. To facilitate this data blocks must be padded to ensure that their
lengths are always a multiple of four bytes. Padding bytes should be set to zero
when transmiting and their content should be ignored by the receiver.

\subsection{Timing}

\subsubsection{Backoff Period}

\subsubsection{Timeouts}

\subsection{Validation and Sanity Checks}

\subsection{Reserved Fields}

Reserved fields should be set to zero when transmitting and ignored when
receiving.
