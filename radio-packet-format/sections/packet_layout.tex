CU InSpace’s radio packets consist of a packet header followed by one or more
segments called blocks. Each block has its own header followed by a variable
amount of data. All headers and data segments have a length that is a multiple
of four bytes. The layout of a packet is shown in figure \ref{format:packet}.

\subsection{Packet Header}
Every packet is preceded by a 12 byte header. The header contains an amateur
radio call sign and the  packets total length as well as other information which
describes the packet as a whole. The packet header follows the format described
in figure \ref{format:packet-header}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.03\linewidth]{32}
    \bitheader{0-31} \\
    \wordbox[lrt]{1}{Call Sign} \\
    \bitbox[lrb]{16}{} & \bitbox{6}{Length} & \bitbox{5}{Version} &
      \bitbox{5}{\color{lightgray}\rule{\width}{\height}} \\
    \bitbox{4}{Src. Addr.} & \bitbox{12}{Packet Number} &
      \bitbox{16}{\color{lightgray}\rule{\width}{\height}} \\
\end{bytefield}
\caption{Packet header format}
\label{format:packet-header}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Call Sign}
The first six bytes of the packet must contain an amateur radio callsign in
ASCII. If the call sign being used is less than size bytes long, the call sign
will be padded with NUL characters at the end.

\paragraph{Length}
The \emph{Length} field indicates the total length of the packet in bytes. This
includes the packet header.

The length of a packet must always be a multiple of four bytes. Because of this
the \emph{Length} field is encoded in units of four bytes per least significant
bit. Because a packet with a length of zero is not possible, the value in the 
\emph{Length} field is one less than the length of the packet divided by four.
This results in a possible range of packet lengths of four to 256 bytes in
multiples of four (though a valid packet must have a length of at least twelve
bytes).

The folowing equations show how the length of a packet in bytes can be converted
to the corrisponding \emph{Length} value and vice versa.

\begin{align*} 
\text{Length} &= \frac{\text{packet length in bytes}}{4} - 1 \\
\text{packet length in bytes} &= \left(\text{Length} + 1\right) \cdot 4
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Version}
The \emph{Version} field indicates what version of the radio packet format the
packet adheres to. The receiver should not attempt to parse a packet that has a
version number which it does not recognize. The \emph{Call Sign} and
\emph{Version} fields will remain for all future versions of this packet format,
all other fields could change.

\paragraph{Source Address}
This field indicates the source of the packet. Possible device addresses are
listed in table \ref{table:dev-addresses}. 0xF is not a valid source address.

\begin{table*}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Address         &   Device \\
\midrule
0x0             &   Ground Station \\
0x1             &   Rocket \\
0x2 through 0xE &   Reserved for future use \\
0xF             &   Multicast \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Device addresses}
\label{table:dev-addresses}
\end{table*}

\paragraph{Packet Number}
This field contains a count value that should be incremented with every packet
transmition from a given device. The \emph{Packet Number} field together with
the \emph{Source Address} field form the packet's \emph{Deduplication Code}.
See section \ref{subsec:other-considerations_deduplication} for more information
on deduplication.

\subsection{Block Header}
Every block starts with a four byte block header. This header indicates the type
of information contained in the block as well as the blocks’s intended
recipient. The block header is formated as described in figure
\ref{format:block-header}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.03\linewidth]{32}
    \bitheader{0-31} \\
    \bitbox{5}{Block Length} & \bitbox{1}{\tiny Sig.} &
      \bitbox{4}{Type} & \bitbox{6}{Subtype} & \bitbox{4}{\small Dest. Addr.} &
      \bitbox{12}{\color{lightgray}\rule{\width}{\height}}
\end{bytefield}
\caption{Block header format}
\label{format:block-header}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Block Length}
The \emph{Block Length} indicates how many bytes are in the block, including the
block header. The offset of the the block after the current block is equal to
the sum of the offset of the current block and the current blocks length.

The length of a block must always be a multiple of four, therefore the
\emph{Block Length} field is encoded in units of four bytes per least
significant bit. Because a valid block will always contain at least 4 bytes, the
value of the \emph{Block Length} field is one less than the length of the block
divided by four. This means that the field has a range from four bytes to 128
bytes in four byte increments.

The folowing equations show how the length of a block in bytes can be converted
to the corrisponding \emph{Length} value and vice versa.

\begin{align*} 
\text{Block Length} &= \frac{\text{block length in bytes}}{4} - 1 \\
\text{block length in bytes} &= \left(\text{Block Length} + 1\right) \cdot 4
\end{align*}

If the length of a block is such that some or all of the block would exceed the
total packet length, then the block is invalid and will be ignored.

\paragraph{Has Signature (Sig.)}
The \emph{Has Signature} bit is used for cryptographic signing. See
section \ref{sec:signatures} for more details.

\paragraph{Type}
The block \emph{Type} field indicates the purpose of the block. Possible values
are listed in table \ref{table:block-types}. Block types are discussed in more
detail in section \ref{sec:block-formats}.

\begin{table*}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
Value           &   Block Type \\
\midrule
0x0             &   Control \\
0x1             &   Command \\
0x2             &   Data \\
0x3 through 0xF &   Reserved for future use \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Block types}
\label{table:block-types}
\end{table*}

\paragraph{Subtype}
The \emph{Subtype} indicates the type of information or request contained in the
block. The possible block subtypes for each block type are listed and  discussed
in more detail in section \ref{sec:block-formats}.

\paragraph{Destination Address}
This field indicates what device the block is intended for. Received blocks 
which are intended for a different device should be ignored. Possible addresses
are listed in table \ref{table:dev-addresses}. A destination address of
\lstinline{0xF} indicates that the block is intended for anyone who receives it.
