# CUInSpace Telemetry Format

These two documents specify the format to be used for CUInSpace's telemetry data. This repository contains the source
files for building the specification documents, which can be viewed in PDF format.

## Accessing the Specifications

Whenever changes are made, the LaTeX source files are compiled into PDF format. These PDFs are available under the
`Actions` tab on GitHub.

1. Once you click on the tab header, select the latest workflow run named `Auto compilation`.
2. Look for a file called `Telemetry Specifications` under the `Artifacts` header.
3. Click on it to download the specification PDFs in a zip file.
