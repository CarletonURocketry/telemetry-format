# CUInSpace Telemetry Format

These two documents specify the format to be used for CUInSpace's telemetry data. This repository contains the source
files for building the specification documents, which can be viewed in PDF format.

## Accessing the Specifications

Whenever changes are made, the LaTeX source files are compiled into PDF format. The PDF files are commited to the
`gh-pages` branch. You can view them there in GitHub's browser PDF viewer, or you can view them on the GitHub pages link
for the repository.

These PDFs are also available for download under the `Actions` tab on GitHub.

1. Once you click on the tab header, select the latest workflow run named `Auto compilation`.
2. Look for a file called `Telemetry Specifications` under the `Artifacts` header.
3. Click on it to download the specification PDFs in a zip file.
